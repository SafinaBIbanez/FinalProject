The quiz is integrated into my home page/index.html. The questions load as soon as you open the page and you can start answering right away. If you get the answer right, the page tells you "Correct!" and a button that says "Next Question" will appear. If you get it wrong, the page tells you it's incorrect and will say the correct answer, then again, the button "Next Question" will appear. The user will immediately get their score after, showing how many they got right out of the amount of questions there were, such as "3/5". They can only proceed to the next question if they answer the one that they can currently see.
