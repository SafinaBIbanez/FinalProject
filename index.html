			Did you ever notice how over the years, the temperature of Earth gets hotter and hotter? Due to the increase in human
			activities throughout the course of history, climate change has been driven to extreme levels: bringing drought, loss of glaciers, wildfires,
			and floods. If we don't start working toward a solution now, Earth could be put in grave danger.
			</p>

			<p>
			The Glo-PAL Warming website aims to tackle one of the aspects in climate change, yes, that's right! Global warming! Glo-PAL Warming has three
			goals in mind: awareness, action, and secure. We will spread awareness of our goal. We will act to achieve our goals. We will secure a better future
			for all. These are the 3 goals that make up the heart of Glo-PAL Warming.
